# Bilingo

Bilingo is a fullstack framework that use Go as backend, and TS as frontend. It
embraces a domain-driven design and allow us writing Go and TS code side by side.

## Requirements

- Go v1.24+ (backend)
- Node.js v22.0+ (run and build frontend application)
- Deno v2.5+ (manage frontend dependencies, lint and format TS code)

## Domain Framework

Each domain is stored in the [domains](./domains/) directory, take `user` as an
example, it's structure looks like this:

- `api/` API bridges the server and the client
  - `user.go` backend route handlers
  - `user.ts` client bindings
- `models/` domain models, pure data structures of entities
  - `user.go` user model, define the shape of a user entity and db table columns
  - `index.ts` (auto-generated by `go2ts`) model interfaces used in client code
- `repo/` data repositories (optional)
  - `user.go` declares an `IUserRepo` interface and a `UserRepo` instance
  - `db/` the DB implementations of repositories
    - `user.go` the DB implementation of the user repository
- `service/` contains business logic
  - `user.go` contains business logic for users
- `tables/` DB table helpers generated by `gorm gen` CLI according to `models/`
- `types/` universal types/structures for apis, the service, etc.
  - `user.go` types/structures for operations against users
  - `index.ts` (auto-generated by `go2ts`) TS interfaces used in client code
- `views/` frontend pages
- `errors.go` common sentinel errors used in the domain
